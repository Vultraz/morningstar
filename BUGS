Reporting bugs
--------------

This software is still a work-in-progress, and as a such it may contain bugs.

There is an issue tracker for this kind of thing, hosted at Github:

  https://github.com/shikadiqueen/morningstar/issues

When reporting a bug, make sure to provide as much relevant information as
possible; the operating system class (i.e. Windows vs. Mac OS X) and version
(i.e. XP, 7) you are using is extremely important, as well as the steps to
reproduce and the Wesnoth RCX version affected.

Donâ€™t submit bugs for earlier versions of Wesnoth RCX, since those have a high
chance of being fixed in the latest release. If you are in doubt about whether
you are already using the latest version, you can find more information here:
