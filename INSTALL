Wesnoth RCX (codename “Morning Star”) — Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions apply to the source code distribution. If you are using the
provided Windows binary distribution or the Mac OS X application bundle, you
should be able to just run Wesnoth RCX right away.


Dependencies
------------

You will need a basic development environment (i.e. GCC with the C++ compiler),
as well as the Qt development files and the ‘qmake’ tool. The exact procedure
to gather these dependencies varies from system to system.

On Debian and Ubuntu in particular, it should be enough to install the
following packages:

  * build-essential
  * libqt4-dev
  * qt4-qmake

Wesnoth RCX should build and run with Qt 4.6 and later, and GCC 4.4 and later.

KDE is not required to build or run Wesnoth RCX, but it provides additional
image reader plug-ins handling GIMP .xcf files and Adobe Photoshop .psd files;
Wesnoth RCX can read these formats when these plug-ins are available.


Building from source
--------------------

First you need to generate a Makefile:

  $ cd wesnoth-rcx-X.Y.Z/
  $ qmake -config release

Then you can build the application:

  $ make

An executable file ‘wesnoth-rcx’ will be generated in the current directory.


Installing
----------

For your convenience, the provided ‘install’ target will install Wesnoth RCX
to /usr/local/bin and add an applications menu entry for you:

  $ sudo make install

Or (as root):

  # make install

If this does not fit your needs, you can copy the executable file generated in
the previous step to a different location, such as $HOME/bin, or just keep it
where it is — installation is *not* strictly necessary. However, you may want
to manually create a desktop or applications menu launcher for easy access.
