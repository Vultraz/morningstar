Wesnoth RCX (codename “Morning Star”) — Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions apply to the source code distribution. If you are using the
provided Windows binary distribution or the Mac OS X application bundle, you
should be able to just run Wesnoth RCX right away.


Dependencies
------------

You will need a basic development environment (i.e. GCC with the C++ compiler),
as well as the Qt development files and the ‘qmake’ tool. The exact procedure
to gather these dependencies varies from system to system.

On Debian and Ubuntu in particular, it should be enough to install the
following packages:

  * build-essential
  * libqt4-dev
  * qt4-qmake

Wesnoth RCX should build and run with Qt 4.6 and later, and GCC 4.4 and later.

KDE is not required to build or run Wesnoth RCX, but it provides additional
image reader plug-ins handling GIMP .xcf files and Adobe Photoshop .psd files;
Wesnoth RCX can read these formats when these plug-ins are available.


Building from source
--------------------

First you need to generate a Makefile:

  $ cd wesnoth-rcx-X.Y.Z/
  $ qmake -config release

Then you can build the application:

  $ make

An executable file ‘wesnoth-rcx’ will be generated in the current directory.
You can copy this file to a suitable location in PATH, such as $HOME/bin or
/usr/local/bin, or just keep it where it is — installation is not strictly
necessary. However, you may want to create a desktop or menu launcher for easy
access.
