Wesnoth RCX (codename “Morning Star”) — Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Since I’ve got no packagers to help at the moment, the only way to install for
now is from source. Since I’ve been working only with Qt Creator so far,
there's no specific build recipe other than the project file
(‘morningstar.pro’), which you are expected to use to generate a Makefile using
QMake.

To do this, just make sure you have Qt4’s development files and QMake installed
(package ‘qt4-qmake’ on Debian and Ubuntu), and type the command as follows:

 $ qmake morningstar.pro

NOTE: If you have Qt3’s version of QMake installed, you may have to explicitly
use ‘qmake-qt4’ instead to avoid confusing the generator and messing up the
sources.

Once QMake generates the Makefile, just issue ‘make’ and wait for compilation
to finish. The binary ‘morningstar’ will appear in the source dir, and you can
now run it from there — no installation is required.
