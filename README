Wesnoth RCX (codename “Morning Star”) — Read-Me
-----------------------------------------------

This is a Qt4-based application for recoloring Wesnoth graphics using the
game’s color range-based Team Coloring algorithm, or optionally palette-based
recoloring.

Born from the same source as Wesnoth-TC [1], RCX is intended to be as
user-friendly as possible in order to appeal to the artists and enthusiasts in
the audience.


Installing
----------

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions.


Usage
-----

To start RCX, just run the “morningstar” executable. You’ll be asked to choose
a file to open. Once done, you’ll be presented the complete user interface,
where you can preview your file after applying a recolor transformation with
different settings and, optionally, generate new image files with your changes.

Currently only the three main source palettes (TC magenta, flag green and
ellipse red) are supported, along with the 9 team color ranges used in mainline
Wesnoth. Support for custom ranges and palettes is planned to be added in the
future.


Reporting bugs
--------------

All bugs in Wesnoth RCX should be reported by email to <shadowm@wesnoth.org> —
please include “[RCX]” in your message’s subject line to speed up the process,
since I occasionally ignore my email inbox unless there are messages with
unusually descriptive subjects. ;-)


Have lots of fun!
